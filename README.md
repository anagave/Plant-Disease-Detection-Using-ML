# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-ML
Agricultural productivity is something on which economy highly depends. This is the major
reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having
disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious
effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is
affected. The Existing methods failed to detect plant diseases accurately and efficiently. The
proposed method will provide a robust system based on deep learning techniques such as
Convolutional neural networks (CNN), ResNet - 152 are used to visualise various plant
diseases. The Proposed system will detect plant diseases accurately and efficiently which will
meet all the bench marks.
Keywords: Plant disease, Deep learning, Convolutional neural networks (CNN), ResNet -
152.
